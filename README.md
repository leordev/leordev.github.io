# Just my New Portfolio Website

I built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) on top of
[Particle Theme](https://github.com/nrandecker/particle/fork) - which
from now on I will recommend to everybody! :)

Feel free to fork me and create your own portfolio :)

## Basic Setup

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
2. Fork this or [Particle Theme](https://github.com/nrandecker/particle/fork)
3. Clone the repo you just forked.
4. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.

## Site and User Settings

You have to fill some informations on `_config.yml` to customize your site.

## Running the blog in local

In order to compile the assets and run Jekyll on local you need to follow those steps:

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Run `npm install`
- Run `gulp`
